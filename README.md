# Verification_of_ALU_using_systemverilog
Verification of ALU is done by systemverilog using Questa sim tool.
The Questa advanced simulator is the core simulation and debug engine of the Questa verification solution; the comprehensive advanced verification platform capable of reducing the risk of validating complex FPGA and SoC designs.
Here i have attached the Questa coverage report of ALU testbench.
