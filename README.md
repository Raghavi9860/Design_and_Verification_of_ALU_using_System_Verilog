# Design_and_Verification_of_ALU_using_System_Verilog
Verification of ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) with 8-bit input is built using system verilog using Questa Sim tool.
The Questa Sim is comprehensive advanced verification platform capable of reducing the risk of validating complex FPGA and SoC designs.

Here i have attached the Questa coverage report of ALU testbench.
